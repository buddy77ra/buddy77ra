### 🌱 About Me

🎓 I’m currently taking a **Web Development course at Trios College**, eager to see what this next chapter of my life consists of.  
🤝 I’m also hoping to **collaborate with others**, grow as a developer, and build meaningful projects.  
💬 I love talking to and meeting new people — tech is cool, but **people make it awesome**.  
🌲 In my free time, you’ll find me **outdoors**, enjoying nature and fresh air.
